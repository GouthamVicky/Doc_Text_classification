### Document Classification using Scikit-Learn
This project demonstrates how to classify text documents into different categories using Scikit-Learn, a popular machine learning library in Python. We will use a dataset containing various types of documents such as bank statements, passports, electricity bills, phone bills, PAN cards, driving licenses, Aadhar cards, bank passbooks, and rental agreements.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various types of documents in the following classes:

- Bank Statement
- Passport
- Electricity Bill
- Phone Bill
- PAN Card
- Driving License
- Aadhar Card
- Bank Passbook
- Rental Agreement

This dataset has been created for educational purposes and can be used to train machine learning models for document classification.

###  Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need the following:

Python 3.x
Scikit-Learn library
Pandas library
Numpy library
You can install Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and Numpy using pip.
